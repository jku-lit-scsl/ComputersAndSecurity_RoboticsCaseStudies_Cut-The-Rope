# ComputersAndSecurity_RoboticsCaseStudies_Cut-The-Rope

This repository contains the code used to run the two case studies in the paper by

Stefan Rass, Sandra Konig, Jasmin Wachter, VÃ­ctor Mayoral-Vilches, Emmanouil Panaousis, "Game-Theoretic APT defense: An Experimental Study on Robotics", Computers & Security (2023), doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2023.103328.

The files contained are the following:
attack_graph_MIR100.R   Attack graph from the MIR100 use case
attack_graph_MARA.R     Attack graph from the MARA use case
ctr-core_1.R            Core implementation of the Cut-The-Rope Game (called by the subsequent experimental scripts)
HyRiM_2.0.1.tar.gz      R-Package "HyRiM"; either installable directly from this file, or (better) from the official CRAN repository at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/HyRiM/index.html
heuristic_defense.R     Baseline heuristic (uniform defense) from Section 5.1
experiment_1.R          Experiment from Section 5.3, MARA, periodic defender, exponential attacker, results shown in Figure 3
experiment_2.R          Experiment from Section 5.3, MARA, exponential defender, exponential attacker, results shown in Figure 4
experiment_3.R          Experiment from Section 5.4, MIR100, periodic defender, exponential attacker, results shown in Figure 5
experiment_4.R          Experiment from Section 5.4, MIR100, exponential defender, exponential attacker, results shown in Figure 5

The files ending with _H.R are the respective heuristic defenses (Section 5.1) for each experiment
The files endling with .log are the outputs as produced by the respective scripts (examples)

To re-run an experiment, just source the file in R, but make sure to have set the working directory of R to the folder where all the files are located.
